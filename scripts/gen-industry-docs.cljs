;; Regenerate the GENERATED markdown blocks in README.md, docs/engineering.md
;; and docs/isic-coverage.md from resources/kotoba/industry/registry.edn, so
;; those docs cannot silently drift from the data file the way the old
;; hand-curated "Current ISIC Blueprints" table and docs/cloud-itonami.md's
;; hand-typed counts did (see 90-docs/adr ... industry-registry-cleanup, and
;; docs/cloud-itonami.md's own note about a prior stale-count incident).
;;
;; Usage: nbb scripts/gen-industry-docs.cljs [--check]
;;   (no args)  -- rewrite the GENERATED blocks in place
;;   --check    -- exit non-zero if regenerating would change any file
;;                 (does not write)
;;
;; Runtime: nbb (ClojureScript-on-Node), per this workspace's runtime
;; priority for new Node-side scripts (kotoba wasm > clojurewasm > cljs >
;; nbb > jvm/bb).

;; Generate an honest, registry- and blueprint-grounded `docs/business-model.md`
;; baseline for a cloud-itonami fleet actor. The flagship landings (6399 Meta
;; Job Search / 6310 Talent Board / 7810 Placement Desk) carry hand-written,
;; domain-deep business models; this script gives every other implemented
;; actor a generated baseline so the catalog's business-model.md promise is
;; met uniformly. It fabricates nothing: every concrete figure is labeled
;; illustrative / not-yet-measured, and the actor-specific depth is cited from
;; the actor's own blueprint.edn rather than invented.
;;
;; Usage (from anywhere):
;;   nbb scripts/gen-actor-business-model.cljs <path-to-actor-repo>
;;   nbb scripts/gen-actor-business-model.cljs <path-to-actor-repo> --check   ;; exit non-zero if the file would change (no write)
;;
;; The actor repo must contain blueprint.edn; docs/business-model.md is
;; (over)written. The operating-states come from this repo's registry.edn
;; (matched by the blueprint's :itonami.blueprint/isic-rev5).

;; ## This file is the canonical copy. The archive repos vendor it.
;;
;; It lives here, beside `lei-acquire.cljs` and the rest of the family's
;; generators, because this superproject is what creates and registers the
;; `cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-lei-*` repos. Each of those repos carries a
;; byte-identical copy at `scripts/verify-facts.cljs` under a VENDORED header
;; naming this path and a commit.
;;
;; The copies are not a mistake to be cleaned up. An archive repo's value is
;; that a single `git clone` of it can be verified against the live registry
;; with no workspace, no west, and no dependency resolution. Deleting the copy
;; and depending on this file would take that away. So the copy stays, and
;; `scripts/verify-vendored-copies.cljs` performs the diff instead.
;;
;; Everything the script needs about a particular company it reads from that
;; repo's `blueprint.edn` (`:company/lei`) -- there is nothing per-company in
;; here, which is why one canonical is possible at all.
;;
;; Measured 2026-08-21, which is why this file exists: four repos in the family
;; had a copy, in THREE different shapes -- 334, 429 and 463 lines, no two
;; alike. The 463-line one was a strict superset (25 fns to the oldest's 19);
;; each had been copied forward from the last and then extended in place. All
;; three were written by the same maturity loop on three consecutive
;; iterations. `verify-vendored-copies.cljs` is exactly the detector for this,
;; and it had seen none of them: it scanned only `src` and `src-*` roots, and
;; this family keeps its script in `scripts/`. A detector that cannot reach a
;; file reports the same silence as one that read it and found nothing.

   that matters: it is the only combination under which facts.edn ends up
   saying nothing whatsoever about this entity's parent, and without this check
   that emptiness reads exactly like a company that genuinely has none.

   of its endpoints gave one of those. A request that never got an HTTP answer

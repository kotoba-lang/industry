# kotoba-industry

Industry registry for kotoba-lang and itonami open businesses.

This repository maps ISIC-coded businesses to the technology capabilities they
need in order to operate. `cloud-itonami-*` uses this to move from a published
business model to an executable operating stack.

## Contract

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.industry :as industry])

(industry/get-industry "3512")
(industry/required-technologies "3600")
(industry/readiness "8691" #{:forms :identity :audit-ledger :bpmn :dmn})
```

## Layers

- business: customer-facing open business model
- industry: ISIC-coded operating domain
- technology: reusable kotoba-lang capability stack
- implementation: concrete repos, services and operators

## Current ISIC Blueprints

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ISIC BLUEPRINTS (nbb scripts/gen-industry-docs.cljs) -->

A curated highlight set (community/open-business reference blueprints, plus every implemented engineering/heavy-industry/mining ISIC entry). This block is generated from `resources/kotoba/industry/registry.edn` -- do not hand-edit it, run `nbb scripts/gen-industry-docs.cljs` instead. The full list of all 347 `:implemented` entries lives in [`docs/isic-coverage.md`](docs/isic-coverage.md).

<!-- END GENERATED ISIC BLUEPRINTS -->

Engineering/manufacturing ISICs can add EDA/CFD/CAE through the same registry.

## Legacy ISIC group codes and supersession

The registry was originally seeded with a broad ISIC skeleton at 3-digit
**group** granularity (e.g. `"241"`), then filled in with the proper 4-digit
ISIC Rev.4 **class** granularity one real actor at a time (e.g. `"2410"`).
Where a legacy group entry has a real, more specific `:implemented`
successor, it is marked `:superseded-by ["2410"]` (or, for the small number
of legacy group ids that were themselves directly implemented,
`:superseded-code`) rather than silently deleted -- see
`docs/isic-coverage.md` for the full generated breakdown of superseded vs.
genuinely-unimplemented legacy entries.

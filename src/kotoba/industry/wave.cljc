  "Reverse-topological rollout waves over ISIC Rev.4 (ADR-2607121000).

  Edge definition: u -> v means \"operating division v consumes
  division u's output as a required operating input\". A reverse
  topological sort of that dependency DAG orders divisions from the
  most-depended-upon roots (settlement/finance, information, then
  governance/energy) outward to the consumer-facing leaves (health,
  education, personal services). Every wave N+1 transaction settles,
  communicates and complies through wave N, so value capture is
  on-order only when lower-numbered waves become agent-operable
  first. The wave number is therefore a rollout priority, not a
  quality tier: it composes with (not replaces) the :spec ->
  :blueprint -> :implemented maturity ladder.

  Pure data + fns (.cljc, no registry IO): codes come in as strings
  (section letter, 2-digit division, 3-digit group or 4-digit class).
  `kotoba.industry/execution-plan`, `maturity-roadmap` and
  `wave-maturity-summary` attach :wave from here."

  "Append-only canvas ledger — 1 EDN event map per line. Extracted from
   70-tools/bmc's gftd.ledger verbatim (zero product/path literals in the
   original — the ledger file path is always a caller-supplied arg).
   Never rewritten, never reordered; the fold (bmc.canvas) is the only reader
   that gives events meaning. Event shape:

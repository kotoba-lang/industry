(ns bmc.gate
  "Gate evaluator: turn collected metrics into hypothesis progression so a
   portfolio BMC actually *cycles* on a schedule instead of going dry.
   Extracted from 70-tools/bmc's gftd.gate (ADR-2607022100) into a reusable
   library (ADR-260719XXXX) — the evaluator half only. The concrete per-
   hypothesis `gate-specs` table (product/metric-path literals) is NOT part
   of this library; it stays in the consumer (e.g. 70-tools/bmc's gftd.cli)
   as config data and is passed into `proposals` explicitly.

   Per riskiest hypothesis, a gate-spec is either:
   - machine-measurable — {:metric [path...] :op :>= :threshold N} over the
     product's metrics edn. When satisfied → propose `hyp/status :validated`
     with the measured value as evidence (auto-advance). When measurable but
     not yet met → promote hyp to :measuring once + emit a 'gate distance'
     observation (hyp no longer stays untested when the instrument is live).
   - instrument-blocked — {:needs [\"missing instrument\" ...]}. The gate can't be
     measured until those are prepared, so propose a concrete '準備:' item into
     the solution block (actionable to-do) and record the gate as :blocked.

   Pure .cljc; io stays in the consumer's cli/collect layer."
